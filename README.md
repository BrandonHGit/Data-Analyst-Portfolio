# Brandon Hindman's Data Analyst Portfolio

Hey! Thanks for stopping by my Git. This repository contains some examples of SQL I have written while working through SQL and Tableau courses. Below are some projects I have completed including some data visualization through Tableau. Please feel free to look through this collection of example projects and feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-h123/) if you have any questions or feedback.

## SQL Projects
* **Global Youtube Statistics '23 - [SQL](https://github.com/BrandonHGit/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Global%20Youtube%20Statistics%20'23): In this project I used a dataset from Kaggle.com to analyze trends of the top ~1,000 most popular Youtube channels as of August 2023. I created the database repository as well as a table for importing of the dataset in PgAdmin4. I re-organized the date columns into a single MM-DD-YYYY formatted column and began probing basic questions such as 'What are the 10 most popular channels based on subscribers?.'
