# Brandon Hindman's Data Analyst Portfolio

Hey! Thanks for stopping by my Git. This repository contains some examples of SQL I have written while working through SQL and Tableau courses. Below are some projects I have completed including some data visualization through Tableau. Please feel free to look through this collection of example projects and feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-h123/) if you have any questions or feedback.

## SQL Projects
* **Global Youtube Statistics '23** - [SQL](https://github.com/BrandonHGit/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Youtube%20Global%20Statistics%20'23.sql): In this project I used a dataset from Kaggle.com to analyze trends of the top ~1,000 most popular Youtube channels as of August 2023. I created the database repository as well as a table for importing of the dataset in PgAdmin4. I began probing basic questions such as 'What are the 10 most popular channels based on subscribers?'

## Tableau Projects
* **Global Youtube Statistics '23** - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brandon.hindman/viz/YoutubeGlobalStatistics23/Sheet1?publish=yes): In this project I used a dataset from Kaggle.com to analyze trends of the top ~1,000 most popular Youtube channels as of August 2023. I created a packed bubble chart of the top 10 channels based on subscription count.
